- 👋 Hi, I’m @fkpImaBadcoder
- 👀 I’m interested in figuring out how to write stable usable code to drive hardware, apply algorithms, manage large numbers of files, ... routine lab rat stuff. Yes, I could do this in LabView, Matlab, and other tools. Maybe I just like beating my head against a wall. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how out of it I really am. I look at the .cpp source here and find I'm 20+ years out of date. And forget the build instructions. I don't have time to learn better. But everything has a learning curve, and I'm on this one.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... probably nothing. I can't imagine I add anything to anybody, and am not going to be just a taker.
- 📫 How to reach me: probably not going to happen. Pointless, I know.
